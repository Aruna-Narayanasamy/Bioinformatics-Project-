# Introduction:
 *Colon cancer (colorectal cancer)* is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. It develops when abnormal cells in the colon or rectum grow uncontrollably and forming tumors that can spread to other organs.
Although several treatments exist, many patients face challenges like drug resistance, low drug response, and severe side effects. This highlights the urgent need for new and more effective drug options.

 *Traditional drug discovery* methods are *slow, expensive, and rely heavily on laboratory experiments*. To overcome these limitations computational approaches such as *Drug–Target Interaction (DTI) prediction* have gained importance in identifying new therapeutic possibilities.

 This project uses *Deep learning*, a powerful branch of artificial intelligence to predict potential drug–target interactions related to colon cancer. Data obtained from public databases will be used to train a model that learns patterns from known interactions and predicts new or repurposed drugs that might be effective.

 The *motivation* behind this project is to support *faster, cost-effective, and data-driven drug discovery*, ultimately helping identify potential drug candidates that could aid in the treatment of colon cancer.

# Objectives:
 The main objective of this project is to use *Deep learning Techniques to predict Drug–Target Interactions (DTIs)** related to *colon cancer* with the goal of identifying potential new or repurposed drugs for treatment.

## Specific Objectives:

 -To identify and study the key protein targets involved in colon cancer progression.

 -To collect and prepare drug and target data from public databases.

 -To develop a deep learning model capable of predicting interactions between drugs and protein targets.

 -To evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model using standard metrics 

 -To predict new potential drug–target interactions relevant to colon cancer.

-To interpret and visualize the predicted results to understand their biological and clinical relevance.
