# Workflow
  - This project follows a *computational (in silico)* approach using deep learning to predict potential *Drug–Target Interactions (DTIs)* for colon cancer. 
 ## key stages :

**1.Target and Drug Identification**
  - Identify important protein targets involved in colon cancer.
  - Collect drug information (approved and experimental drugs) from databases (DrugBank, ChEMBL, PubChem).

**2.Data Collection**
  - Retrieve known drug–target interaction data from publicly available databases (BindingDB, ChEMBL).
*Extract:*
  - Drug data: SMILES strings, molecular fingerprints, and chemical descriptors.
  - Protein data: amino acid sequences, UniProt IDs, or structural information.

**3.Data Preprocessing**
  - *Convert drugs and proteins into numerical formats* suitable for deep learning models:
  - *Drugs* converted into *fingerprints or molecular embeddings*.
  - *Proteins* converted into *sequence or structure embeddings*.
  - *Clean, normalize, and split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets*.

**4.Model Development**
  - Implement a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or Graph Neural Network) using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - Train the model using known DTI data to learn patterns between drug and protein features.
  - *Optimize hyperparameters* such as *learning rate, batch size, and epochs* for best performance.

**5.Model Evaluation**
  - Evaluate model accuracy using *Standard Performance Metrics* (ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score).
  - Compare performance with baseline models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
    
**6.Prediction and Validation**
  - Use the trained model to *predict new Drug–Target Interactions* for colon cancer targets.
  - Identify *High-Confidence predictions* as potential new or repurposed drugs.
  - Perform *Biological Validation* by comparing with known colon cancer pathways or literature evidence.

**7.Visualization and Reporting**
  - Visualize results using tools (matplotlib, NetworkX, or Cytoscape).
  - Create *Drug–Target Interaction Network diagrams and pathway maps*.
  - Summarize findings in tables, graphs, and visual flowcharts.
