# Colon:
- It's the *longest part of the large intestine* approximately *1.5 meters* (5 feet) long and plays a vital role in the digestive system.
- Also known as Large intestine, is the final part of digestive system.
- It is responsible for *absorbing water and nutrients from digested food material* and forming stool. The colon hosts a large population of microorganisms that aid digestion and &produce essential vitamins like vitamin K and some B vitamins* which are absorbed into the bloodstream.
- It extends from the *ileocecal junction* (where the small intestine ends) to the *rectum*
## Development of Colon
- After fertilization a *zygote* is formed. By *3–4 days* it becomes a *morula* and by *5–6 days* a *blastocyst* develops.
- The blastocyst has two layers:
    - *Outer cell mass (trophoblast)*. It's developed into the *placenta*.
    - *Inner cell mass* it forms the *embryo*.
- During the *third week* *gastrulation* occurs.
- It forms *three germ layers*:
    - *Ectoderm* forms nervous system, skin.
    - *Mesoderm* forms muscles, connective tissue.
    - *Endoderm* forms epithelial lining of the gut.
- By *week 4* the *primitive gut tube* forms and dividing into *foregut, midgut, and hindgut*.
    - *Colon** arises from Midgut and Hindgut.
    - *Midgut* forms ascending colon, proximal two-thirds of transverse colon
    - *Hindgut* forms distal one-third of transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum
- Between *weeks 5–10* the colon develops its *epithelial lining, muscular layers, and vasculature*.
  
## Parts of Colon
- **Ascending colon** – Runs upward on the right side of the abdomen.  
- **Transverse colon** – Crosses the abdominal cavity horizontally.  
- **Descending colon** – Travels down the left side of the abdomen.  
- **Sigmoid colon** – S-shaped part that connects to the rectum.
