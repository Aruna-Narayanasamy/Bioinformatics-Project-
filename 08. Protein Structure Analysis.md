# Protein Structure Analysis
 - Protein structure analysis was performed to understand how **functionally significant genetic variants** identified through variant annotation, may alter protein structure and biological function.
 - This step bridges the gap between **genomic variation and molecular-level mechanisms** in colorectal cancer.
 - Structural analysis was conducted only for selected genes because not all proteins have available or suitable structural models.

 ## Rationale for Structural Analysis
 - While variant annotation predicts the functional impact of mutations at the genomic and protein sequence level
 - Structural analysis provides:
    - Spatial context for amino acid changes
    - Insight into domain loss or conformational alterations
    - Understanding of how mutations affect protein stability, interactions, and activity
    - This analysis helps translate **variant effect predictions into mechanistic interpretations**.

 ## Selection Criteria for Structural Analysis
 - Although variants were identified in multiple colorectal cancer–associated genes only a subset was selected for structure-based analysis.
 - The selection was based on the following criteria:
   - **High or moderate predicted impact** from variant annotation
   - **Biological relevance** in colorectal cancer
   - **Availability of structural information** (experimental structures or reliable models)
   - **Representative mutation mechanisms**, such as truncating mutations, activating missense mutations
- Based on these criteria **APC and KRAS** were selected for detailed structural interpretation.

 ## Structural Analysis Strategy
 - Different structural strategies were applied depending on protein characteristics and mutation type:
 - **Large proteins with limited structural coverage** were analyzed using:
   - Domain architecture
   - Truncation effects
   - Loss of functional regions
- **Smaller proteins with well-characterized structures** were analyzed using:
   - Experimental 3D structures
   - Structure-based mutation modeling
   - Local conformational comparison
- This flexible strategy ensured biologically meaningful interpretation for each protein.

 ## Integration with Variant Annotation
 - Structural analysis was guided by results from variant annotation, which provided:
   - Mutation type (e.g., missense, nonsense, frameshift)
   - Affected protein regions
   - Predicted functional impact
 - Only **variants deemed biologically significant were carried forward into structural analysis**, ensuring a targeted and interpretable workflow.

## Outcome of the Structure Analysis Step
- This step enabled:
  - Prioritization of mutations with clear structural consequences
  - Visualization of mutation-induced structural changes
  - Interpretation of how genomic variants may disrupt protein function
- Detailed structural analyses of APC and KRAS are presented in separate documentation files.

## Tools and Resources Used
 - The following tools and resources were used during structural analysis:
 - **Protein Data Bank (PDB)** for experimentally determined structures
 - **SWISS-MODEL** for homology modeling when full structures were unavailable
 - **PyMOL** for structure visualization and analysis
 - **UCSF ChimeraX** for structure editing and mutation modeling
 - All structural visualizations were performed using standard molecular graphics workflows.
