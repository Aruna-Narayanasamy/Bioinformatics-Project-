Introduction
Colon cancer, also known as **colorectal cancer**, begins in the lining of the large intestine (colon) or rectum.  
It usually develops slowly over several years, starting as small benign growths called **polyps**.  
When these polyps accumulate genetic mutations, they can transform into **malignant (cancerous)** tumors.
