# Gene Mutation Analysis
  This document summarizes the complete workflow I performed for colon cancer gene mutation analysis using the **cBioPortal (TCGA‑GDC COAD dataset)**. 

  I collected mutation information for key colorectal cancer–associated genes such as **APC, KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. 

  The steps below describe **how I downloaded mutation data, selected transcripts, extracted reference sequences, manually edited mutations, translated protein sequences, and assessed functional impact of variants**.
