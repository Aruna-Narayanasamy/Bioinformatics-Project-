# Genes Selected for Mutation Analysis
-----
 ## Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) 
  - It was selected as the primary annotation tool in this project because it is:
  - Widely used and well-validated in genomics research  
  - Maintained by Ensembl with up-to-date gene and transcript annotations  
  - Capable of predicting the functional consequences of genetic variants  
  - Able to link genomic changes to protein-level effects  
  - Compatible with standard VCF input formats  
  - Using VEP allowed systematic and standardized annotation of all variants present in the VCF file before performing any downstream analysis.

 ### Why VEP was choosen:
  - Standardized consequence terms (e.g., `missense_variant`, `stop_gained`)
  - Clear impact classification (HIGH / MODERATE / LOW)
  - Transcript-specific annotations  
  - Protein-level change predictions  

This made it suitable for selecting biologically relevant variants for further protein structure analysis.

 ### Variant Annotation
  - Variant annotation was performed using the Ensembl VEP web interface, which is suitable for small to medium-scale analyses and provides standardized, high-quality annotations.
  - The VCF file used in this project contains selected variants from clinically and biologically important cancer-associated genes.  
  - Each gene was chosen to demonstrate how different types of variants (e.g., `missense_variant`, `stop_gained`, `frameshift_variant`, `splice_region_variant`) affect protein function.
  - VEP was used to annotate all variants and classify their predicted molecular consequences before selecting genes for structural analysis.

# Summary of the VEP Step

In this step of the project:

1. Variants from the input VCF file were annotated using **Ensembl VEP**.  
2. VEP classified each variant based on its predicted molecular consequence.  
3. Genes affected by these variants were identified and documented, including:  
   - **APC, KRAS, TP53, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, and SMAD4**  
4. For each gene, example VEP consequence types were linked to their biological function.  
5. This annotation step provided the biological foundation for downstream analysis.  

Based on VEP results and selection criteria (impact, relevance, and structure availability), **APC and KRAS** were chosen for detailed protein structure analysis in the next step.
