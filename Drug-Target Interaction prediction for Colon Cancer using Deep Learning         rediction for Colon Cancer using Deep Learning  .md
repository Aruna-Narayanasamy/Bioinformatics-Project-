# Overview:
 This project focuses on applying **Deep Learning Techniques** to predict potential **Drug–Target Interactions (DTIs)** associated with **colon cancer**.  
The goal is to identify new or repurposed drugs that can effectively target key molecules involved in the progression of colon cancer thereby contributing to computational drug discovery.
Through the integration of **biological databases** , **molecular data**, and **AI-driven models** this project aims to provide a predictive framework that can:
- Improve the accuracy of drug–target prediction.
- Reduce experimental time and cost in drug discovery.
- Help in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying colon cancer.

This repository includes files describing:
- **Introduction** and **Objective**
- **Biological background of colon cancer** 

By combining **Bioinformatics** and **Deep Learning**, this project supports the advancement of **precision medicine** and **data-driven drug development** in oncology.
