# Structural Analysis of KRAS (Wild-Type vs G12C Mutant)
 - This document describes the structural analysis of the KRAS protein, comparing the wild-type structure with the G12C point mutant using PyMOL.
 - The analysis focuses on structural alignment and visualization of the mutation-induced local changes without interpreting functional or drug-binding effects.

## Analysis Focus:
 - Loading and preparation of KRAS wild-type and mutant structures
 - Structural cleaning and standardization
 - Structural alignment of mutant with wild-type
 - Visualization of mutation site (G12C)
 - Comparative labeling of wild-type and mutant residues
 - Side-chain and atom-level highlighting of the mutation

## Objective:
 - To structurally compare KRAS wild-type and G12C mutant proteins
 - To visualize the mutation at the same residue position in both structures
 - To highlight side-chain differences introduced by the G12C mutation
---

## Software Used
 - PyMOL Molecular Graphics System

### Step-by-Step Structural Analysis
 **1. Loading KRAS Structures**
  - The KRAS wild-type and G12C mutant PDB files were loaded into PyMOL.
```
load Normal.pdb
load Mutated.pdb
```
 **2.Cleaning and Preparing the Structures**
  - To ensure uniform comparison, **water molecules and heteroatoms were removed**. The protein backbone was displayed using cartoon representation.
```
remove solvent
remove hetatm
hide everything
show cartoon
```
 **3.Structural Alignment**
  - The mutant KRAS structure was aligned with the wild-type structure to assess global structural differences.
```
align Normal, Mutated
```

```
orient
```
  - The alignment showed that **both structures overlap well**, indicating no major global conformational change.

 **4. Highlighting the Mutation Residue**
  - Residue 12 was selected and visualized in both wild-type and mutant structures to locate the mutation site.
```
show sticks, Normal and resi 12
show sticks, mutated and resi 12
```

 **5. Labeling the G12C Mutation**
  - Residue 12 was labeled in both structures to indicate the **amino-acid difference at the same position**.
```
hide labels
label Normal and resi 12 and name CA, "G12 (Normal)"
label Mutated and resi 12 and name CA, "C12 (G12C)"
```
  - Label appearance was adjusted for clarity.
```
set label_size, 18
```

 **6. Labeling Wild-Type and Mutant Structures**
  - To distinguish the two structures, labels were added to indicate wild-type and mutant KRAS.
```
label Normal and resi 1 and name CA, "G12 (Normal)"
label KRAS_G12C and resi 1 and name CA, "Mutant (G12C)"
```

 **7. Hiding Extra Stick Representation**
  - To reduce visual clutter, stick representation was limited to residue 12 only.
```
hide sticks
show sticks, Normal and resi 12
show sticks, Mutated and resi 12
```

 **8. Highlighting the Sulfur Atom of Cysteine**
  - The sulfur atom of cysteine at position 12 in the mutant structure was highlighted to emphasize the chemical difference introduced by the mutation.
```
color yellow, Mutated and resi 12 and elem S
```

 **9.Additional coloring was applied for clarity**
```
color green, Normal
color cyan, Mutated
color magenta, Mutated and resi 12
```

 **10.Visualization Adjustment**
  - The final view was centered on the mutation site.
```
zoom resi 12, 14
```

### Observations
 - KRAS wild-type and G12C mutant structures show strong global structural similarity after alignment.
 - Residue 12 occupies the same spatial position in both structures.
 - The G12C mutation introduces a cysteine side chain with a sulfur atom, whereas the wild-type glycine lacks a side chain.
 - Structural differences are localized to the mutation site.

## Summary
 - This structural analysis demonstrates that the **G12C mutation does not alter the global fold of KRAS but introduces local side-chain and chemical changes at residue 12**.
 - PyMOL-based visualization effectively highlights these differences at residue and atom levels.
